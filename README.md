Sign into your user and make sure they have all access

Now that we have everything set up from out last 2 labs lets creat a Ticket! Have 2 windows open side by side so its easier .

first go to http://localhost/osTicket/ and click open a ticket. With the user youve made for me its Harry fill in the information and create a ticket uner Mobile banking system is down. And put a random help topic realistically the person wont know the best option to put it as. Fill in the text bubble with a relevant message as if there truly is a problem.

Then switch to John on the agent side and sign into you support agent not the admin one. now that we are in you can click on the ticker ***Norman*** just made. Lokk at the screen and you can see a lot of information. Start with looking at the top, whats the status whats the department, Check the SLA, this is what a general ticket may look at.

This is when soft skills come into play, you can either try to work the ticket through the system or email them or call them directly. lets say we call harry and he said its still happening and this is a serious problem change the SLA to Sev A and give a relevant message.

now that we have changed the SLA and fixed the help topic,  assign it to the team we made and refresh you should see the ticket was assigned to that team. and sign in under that team to *work* the ticket 

Sign into your admin account  to work the ticket. go in and assign it to your self with a appropriate message.

and then *work* the ticket, respond with a appropriate message and once youve resolved the case go to the top and put resolved.

Now we will do a practice using chatGPT ask it to help you by acting like a user with a problem and want to practice. tell it to do line by line so you can respond.

As you can see John cant use his email 
first I checked to make sure the user had put in a ticket they responded no and i put one in befoe we started.

afterr that i asked when the problem occurred and how long it has been happening

in the end i couldnt figure out the problem immediately so i let them know i wasnt sure and then let them know that i would do some research on my own and ask a manager above me. 

In the end, the user responded that a restart resolved the issue.

the take away from this lab is how ticketing systems work and how they are operated. It also is great practice for soft skills.
